                <h2>Problem Statement: Campus Social Media App</h2></a>
                <p>You are a new student on UofSC’s campus and you want to start networking with
                    others, but you are having trouble connecting with people, or you are having a problem
                    with finding things to do on campus. Our solution is to create an app that allows users to
                    connect with their peers, professors, alumni, clubs, workplaces, etc… on campus.</p>
